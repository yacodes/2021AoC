# 2021 Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels. I've decided to solve those puzzles in Emacs Lisp.

All puzzles are solved in REPL mode, so running Emacs in scripting mode can produce unexpected results. Will do my best to make it available though:
```sh
$ emacs --script 02-aoc.el
```
